Caesar Cipher (Task 1 - Virtual Internship)

This project is part of my Cybersecurity Virtual Internship.
It implements the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

Description :

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 3:

Plaintext: HELLO

Ciphertext: KHOOR


This program allows:

Encryption of a plaintext message.

Decryption of a ciphertext message.

Custom shift values.


 Features :

Encrypt messages using Caesar Cipher.

Decrypt messages back to original form.

User-defined shift key.

Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.


Requirements:

Python 3.x


▶ How to Run

1. Save the code as caesar_cipher.py.


2. Run in terminal:

python caesar_cipher.py


3. Enter:

A message to encrypt/decrypt

The shift key value


 Example :

Enter your message: HELLO
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted: KHOOR
Decrypted: HELLO


Learning Outcome :

Understood the concept of classical cryptography.

Learned how substitution ciphers work.

Built a hands-on implementation in Python.


Note: The Caesar Cipher is not secure for modern use but serves as a foundation for understanding encryption.
